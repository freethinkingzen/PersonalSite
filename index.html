                    <!-- About Me -->
                    <h2>Let Me Introduce Myself...</h2>
                    <p id="bio">
                        I'm a recent graduate of Portland State University with a B.S. in
                        Computer Science. As a recovering philosophy major, I took a very
                        non-traditional route to a degree with stops at two different colleges
                        and three different majors over the course of 15 years. I have 10 years
                        of large scale retail management and operations experience that have honed
                        my communication, mediation, and conflict resolution skills. My current focus
                        is finding a path into software development by blending my CS skills
                        with my work experience to improve any team or company that I join.
                        <br><br>
                        Professionally, my interests are AI, Machine Learning, Web Development,
                        and the ethics surrounding barriers to technology accessibility, especially
                        those of race, income, and disability. I am proficient in
                        low-level and high-level languages, allowing me to code efficient solutions
                        to bottlenecks and utilize object-oriented programming to organize large projects.
                        I like puzzles and the power of statistics to simplify large problems, so
                        I enjoy the elegance of good datascience and AI algorithms.
                        <br><br>
                        When I'm not coding, I love to lift weights and follow strength sports. I can
                        tell you more than you would ever want or need to know about World's Strongest Man,
                        powerlifting, and bodybuilding. There is a lot of carryover from the skills that make
                         a good lifter to the skills that make a good programmer.
                        <br><br>
                        My other interests include reading dusty old books by dead philosophers,
                        spending time with my wife, everything involving bicycles, hiking, camping,
                        and doing anything that I can in the outdoors.

                        <q> With almost four years' worth of credits already, I assumed I'd be out with a degree in no

                            I began my college career with a deep interest in what makes individuals tick.
                            I pursued a degree in psychology for two years and learned the basic
                            terminology and frameworks to better understand how people develop their
                            basic beliefs, but the science was too soft for the answers I was seeking.
                            This coincided with a renewed popularity in the works of

                            "hardware" that human "software" runs on. I added a major in biology hoping to
                            learn about the brain as a means of understanding the beings they control.

                                , predicate logic, and ethical philosophy in the quietest, dustiest corners of the store. The way I 
                                thought about and understood everything was fundamentally altered forever. 
                                Predicate logic was the mathematics of language, existentialism 
                                explored "being," and ethics explored the implications of our actions as beings.

                                of religion offered an honest assessment of religious belief. I WAS IN LOVE! I returned
                                to school as a philosophy major with a passion. Unfortunately, after my first
                                year of upper division coursework, my university dropped philosophy as a major.
                                I was left adrift, unsure where to go next. Around this time I read Joseph Campbell's
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                                I worked hard, saved money, and moved to Portland, Oregon. I excelled in my retail

                                into the next phase of my life. I could finish my degree in philosophy, but my
                                career potential was limited to being the most highly educated retail manager alive
                                and earning a fairly low salary. While doing the practice questions in my logic
                                textbook as a fun pastime (Nerd Alert!), the seed of an idea began to grow;
                                I realized computer science would
                                give me an opportunity to leverage a background in logic, science, and problem-solving
                                toward a degree with earning potential that wouldn't eventually bore me intellectually.
                                <br><br>
                                With almost four years' worth of credits already, I assumed I'd be out with a degree in no 
                                time. I WAS VERY WRONG. It took more than three years of full course loads, summer classes,
                                and retaking credits to finally earn my degree. I could not have done it without the support
                                of my wife. As a student in my thirties, I managed to make it through
                                the "survival of the fittest" approach to teaching lower division CS, the all-nighters to
                                debug programs, and the calculus/physics that I hadn't touched in more than 10 years.
                                Despite my long road, I have finally found something I excel at and enjoy. I maintained a place on
                                the Dean's List and President's List for high honors throughout my time at Portland State.
                                Finally, after 15 years, I had 280-ish credits, a 3.7 GPA, insight into how people work, arcane
                                knowledge about

                        <p>
                            I was always an active kid. Growing up in Boise, Idaho, (<em>ACTUAL</em> Boise) we
                            rode bikes everywhere, hiked the foothills when we were bored, and skiied in the
                            winter. Home video game consoles were gaining popularity, but those were for rainy
                            weekends and required renting the games and console. I worked on
                            my grandmother's ranch over many weekends and summers and learned the true meaning
                            of hard work. General fitness was just built into my way of life. However, I was
                            always a string bean no matter how many hay bails I lifted or miles I mountainbiked.
                            <br><br>
                            I idolized Schwarzenegger and Stalone, loved Hulk Hogan, and would watch in wonder at
                            the reruns of World's Strongest Man. I fully accepted that I would not look like them,
                            but I was stronger than I appeared

                                from ranch work ("farm strong" is real) and
                                an active lifestyle. Maybe, with work, I could be one strong-ass string bean.
                                I got my hands on
                                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bodybuilding-Weider-Approach-Joe/dp/0809259087">

                                </a>
                                by Joe Weider. I learned about rep ranges, set ranges, and how to structure workouts
                                for progression. I would go to the YMCA with my mom to put my new knowledge into
                                practice. Luckily, the workouts made for mass monsters fueled by anabolics were
                                just about perfect for a pubescent teen: moderate weight, high reps, no recovery time.
                                <br><br>
                                I would go through phases of varying dedication through my teens and twenties, often
                                motivated by vanity more than anything. Then, I traded the P90-x and bodybuilding
                                routines for powerlifting. I was obsessed with the tangible progress that powerlifting
                                offered. Intellectually, there had to be a perfect plan in place
                                to incrementally increase weight and make projections for hitting the biggest lifts.
                                Physically, it allowed me to put every bit of myself into something and get measurable
                                results. Sometimes you give everything you've got to achieve a goal and for one reason
                                or another things just don't go your way, with powerlifting the work you
                                put in directly correlates to the things you achieve. The gym became my church.
                                When nothing else made sense in life, I could always go there and get out what I put in.
                                <br><br>
                                In 2017, I had a devastating knee injury leaving me partially paralyzed that required
                                multiple surgeries and <em>LOTS</em> of physical therapy. Instead of ending my Lifting
                                career, it deepened my love for strength sports. All the tools and mental tricks I 
                                used to improve my weightlifting translated into recovery. I set my goals and worked
                                toward them incrementally with a focus on doing the best I was capable of safely, without
                                over-reaching. I went from a 500lb deadlift to carefully lifting an empty bar. I focused
                                on my form as I re-learned how to walk. I pushed through pain to get my body where I knew 
                                it could go. I can tell you that today I'm stronger than I ever was before and you'd
                                never guess I have any kind of disability thanks to the mindset developed lifting weights.

                                Just as they helped me through hardship, the principles for improving in the gym are
                                helpful in coding. What is practicing algroithms but learning the correct form so you 
                                don't waste energy or break your shit? Are reps and sets not an iterative approach? 
                                Isn't there a waterfall model inherent in deciding a fitness goal, desining a routine,
                                going to the gym, hitting your goals, then maintining your new fitness level? The
                                carryover has helped me practive every day to improve my coding and my knowledge to be
                                the best engineer I can be.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate of Portland State University with a B.S. in
                Computer Science. As a recovering philosophy major, I took a very
                non-traditional route to a degree with stops at two different colleges
                and three different majors over the course of 15 years. I have 10 years
                of large scale retail management and operations experience that have honed
                my communication, mediation, and confict resolution skills. My current focus
                is finding a path into software development by incorperating my CS skills
                into my work experience to improve any team or company that I join.
                <br><br>
                Professionally, my interests are Machine Learning, Web Development,
                and the ethics surrounding barriers to technology accessibility including
                race, income, and disability.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not coding, I love to follow strength sports. I can tell you more than you
                would ever want or need to know about World's Strongest Man, powerlifting,
                and bodybuilding. The gym is my church and I "pray" as often and as heavy as possible.
                <br><br>
                My other interests include reading dusty old books by dead philosophers,
                spending time with my wife, everything bicycles, hiking, camping, and doing
                anything that I can in the outdoors.
                
            </p>
            <h2>My Education Story</h2>
            <p>
                I began my college career with a deep interest in what makes individuals tick and what motivates
                people. I pursued a degree in psychology for two years and learned the basic
                terminology and frameworks to better understand how people develop their
                basic beliefs, but the science was too soft for the answers I was seeking.
                This coincided with a renewed popularity in the works of Richard Dawkins and
                E.O. Wilson as breakthroughs in neuroscience changed our understanding of the
                "hardware" that human "software" runs on. I added a major in biology hoping to
                learn about the brain as a means of understanding the beings they control.
                <br><br>
                During an unplanned, low GPA related "sabbatical,"<span id="ellipses">...</span><span id="more"> I began working in a bookstore. 
                There I found existentialism, existential philosophy,
                and ethical philosophy in the quietest, dustiest corners of the store. The way I 
                thought about and understood everything was fundementally altered forever. 
                Propositional logic and existenial philosophy were the mathematics of language. Existentialism 
                explored "being" and ethics explored the implications of our actions as beings. 
                Epistemology scrutinized knowlege, metaphysics questioned reality, and philosophy
                of religion offered an honest assessment of religious belief. I WAS IN LOVE! I returned
                to school as a philosophy major with a passion. Unfortunately, after my first
                year of upper division coursework, my university dropped philosophy as a major.
                I was left adrift, unsure where to go next. Around this time I read Joseph Campbell's
                "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" and decided it was time to take the heroes' journey.
                <br><br>
                I worked hard, saved money, and moved to Portland, Oregon. I excelled in my retail
                management career, met my hot ass wife, and started to look back to school to move
                into the next phase of my life. I could finish my degree in philosophy, but my
                career potential was limited to being the most highly educated retail manager alive
                and earning a fairly low salary. While doing the practice quesitons in my logic
                textbook for the third time, the seed of an idea began to grow. Computer science would
                give me an opportunity to leverage a background in logic, science, and problem solving
                toward a degree with earning potential that wouldn't eventually bore me intellectually.
                <br><br>
                With almost four years worth of credits already, I assumed I'd be out with a degree in no 
                time. I WAS VERY WRONG. It took more than three years of full course loads, summer classes,
                and retaking credits to finally earn my degree. I could not have done it without the support
                of my wife. As a student in my 30's I managed to make it through
                the "survival of the fittest" approach to teaching lower division CS, the all nighters to
                debug programs, and the calculus/phisics that I hadn't touched in more than 10 years.
                Despite my long road, I found something I excelled at and enjoyed. I maintained a place on
                the Dean's List and President's List for high honors throughout my time at Portland State.
                Finally, after 15 years I had 280 credits, a 3.7 GPA, insight into how people work, arcane
                knowedge about "Being and Time", the tools to code anything, and a magic piece of paper
                that opens the doors to my future.

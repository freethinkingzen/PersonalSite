# My Personal Website

## About This Site ##
This is my website to introduce myself and share my background and experience as a person and as a coder.
I wanted to show my personality more than a resume or business card as a reminder to the people who visit
that I am a human being, not just a list of qualifications. My story and personality are part of what makes
me a great investment for employers or collaborators and make me an excellent developer/engineer as I grow
and develop my skills.

## The Stack ##
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/ECMAScript

## Goals ##
- Introduce myself
- Promote/display my experience in the website itself and the content
- Make an accessible and modern design
- Create a page responsive enough that a desktop user wouldn't think it was mobile first
  and a mobile user wouldn't feel adapted from desktop.
- Show off some cool CSS tricks
- Practice, practice, practice to become a better front end developer.
